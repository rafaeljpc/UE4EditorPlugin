# UE4EditorPlugin

**Version:** Unreal Engine 4.21

## Objective

This plugin is a UE4 Editor plugin that shows how to do the following thing:

- Rename a Component using a button at Editor's Property Pannel 
- Open a Custom Dialog to define some parameters for the creation
    of the Components
- Create and Add Components to the Blueprint in Editor

It is a learning Plugin. The other references are too old, and none of them interact with the NodeTree of the BlueprintEditor.
